First steps with the Final Cut widget toolkit 
=============================================


How to use the library
----------------------

At the beginning of this introduction to the Final Cut
we will start with a small example.

The following example creates an empty 30Ã—10 character dialog.

**File:** *dialog.cpp*
```cpp
#include <final/final.h>

int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{
  finalcut::FApplication app(argc, argv);
  finalcut::FDialog dialog(&app);
  dialog.setText ("A dialog");
  dialog.setGeometry (25, 5, 30, 10);
  app.setMainWidget(&dialog);
  dialog.show();
  return app.exec();
}
```
*(Note: You can close the dialog with the mouse, 
<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F10</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>^</kbd>)*


After entering the source code in *dialog.cpp* you can compile
the above program with gcc:
```cpp
g++ -O2 -lfinal dialog.cpp -o dialog
```


How it works
------------


```cpp
#include <final/final.h>
```
All final cut programs must include the *final.h* header.

```cpp
finalcut::FApplication app(argc, argv);
```
This line creates the `finalcut::FApplication` object `app` with
the command line arguments `argc` and `argv`. This object manages
the application main event loop. It receives keyboard and mouse events
and sends them to the target widgets. You must create an application
object before you can create a widgets object.

The next line
```cpp
finalcut::FDialog dialog(&app);
```
creates the `finalcut::FDialog` object `dialog` with the object `app`
as parent object. The `finalcut::FDialog` class is the base class for
creating dialog windows.

```cpp
dialog.setText ("A dialog");
```
The title bar of the dialog box gets the text "A dialog".

```cpp
dialog.setGeometry (25, 5, 30, 10);
```
The dialog window gets a width of 30 and a height of 10 characters.
The position of the window in the terminal is at x=25 and
y=5 (note: x=1 and y=1 represents the upper left corner).

```cpp
app.setMainWidget(&dialog);
```
The `dialog` object was now selected as the main widget for the application.
When you close the main widget, the entire application quits.


```cpp
dialog.show();
```
A window or widget is not visible directly after its creation.
Only the call of `show()` makes it (and its child objects,
if available) visible.

```cpp
return app.exec();
```
The last line calls `exec()` to start the application and return
the result to the operating system. The started application enters
the main event loop. This loop does not end until the window is
not closed.


Memory Management
-----------------

If you want to create a hierarchy of FObjects (or derived classes/widgets), 
a new FObject must initialize with its parent object.

```cpp
FObject* parent = new FObject();
FObject* child  = new FObject(parent);
```

When you deallocate the used memory of a parent FObject, 
the allocated memory of its child objects will automatically deallocate 
too.

An object can also be assigned to another object later via `addChild()`.

```cpp
FObject* parent = new FObject();
FObject* child = new FObject();
parent->addChild(child);
```

The child object assignment can also remove at any time with 
`delChild()`.

```cpp
FObject* parent = new FObject();
FObject* child  = new FObject(parent);
parent->delChild(child);
```

If an FObject with a parent will remove from the hierarchy, 
the destructor automatically deletes the object assignment from 
its parent object. If a class object doesn't derive from FObject, 
you must implement storage deallocation yourself.
