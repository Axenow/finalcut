----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Final Cut is a C++ class library and widget toolkit with full mouse
support for creating a text-based user interface. The library supports
the programmer to develop an application for the text console. It allows
the simultaneous handling of multiple text windows on the screen.

The C++ class design was inspired by the Qt framework. It provides
common controls like dialog boxes, push buttons, check boxes,
radio buttons, input lines, list boxes, status bars and so on.
