Description: Shared library for the final cut widget toolkit
 The Final Cut is a class library and widget toolkit with full mouse
 support for creating a text-based user interface. The library supports
 the programmer to develop an application for the text console. It allows
 the simultaneous handling of multiple windows on the screen.
 .
 The C++ class design was inspired by the Qt framework. It provides
 common controls like dialog windows, push buttons, check boxes,
 radio buttons, input lines, list boxes, status bars and so on.
 .
 This package contains the shared library necessary to run programs
 compiled with the final cut.
